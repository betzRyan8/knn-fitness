# Fitness_Tracker KNN Analysis

## Project Overiew
The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between variables 'Steps' and 'Heart_Rate_avg' using k-nearest neighbors regression. Furthermore to explore the effects of varying k-values and analyze bias-variance tradeoff.

## Dataset
This project used the dataset "Fitness_Tracker_Data.csv", which includes fitness metrics.
Source: [Kaggle - Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/narinder06/fitness-tracker-data)

## Analysis Highlights
* **KNN Regresssion:** A K-Nearest Neighbors model was utilized to predict 'Heart_Rate_avg' based on 'Steps'.
* **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** This project demonstrates how a varying k-value in knn affects the models complexity, variance, and bias.
* **Optimal K-Value:** Finding an optimal k value that minimizes the out of sample root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used
* R
* RStudio
* 'kknn' R package
